<p> Bill Gates grew up in Seattle with two sisters, one younger, and one older.  He showed interest in computers at a young age, and with the support of his family, he left college to start a company, now known as Microsoft, with his friend Paul Allen. He and his wife, Melinda Gates, now run their charity, giving their hard earned wealth back to the world.  Bill Gates's company has now grown to be a huge, multinational technology company that is known by everyone.

<p> I've selected Bill Gates as my hero because he is one of the few billionaires that are using their acquired wealth for good.  He's donated huge amounts of money to charity and other purposes, not counting his own charity that he runs.  He's also recently donated money to fund the research for a Covid-19 vaccine.  He constantly and consistently does stuff for the good of others, and though he loses money because of it, he does it anyways.
