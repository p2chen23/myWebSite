/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Write questions along with multiple choice answers.  
2. Put the questions and answers in corresponding arrays so that they  have the same index number.  
3. Create two text boxes, one where you can only read, which displays the question, and the other where the user types out their answer.  
4. Create a button that the user presses when they finish typing their answer.  
5. The button calls a function that retrieves the user's answer and checks if it is true or false. 
6. Display an alert depending on the accuracy of the answer, and increase the score variable if it is correct.  
7. The button should also display the contents of the next question, perhaps after the alert is resolved.  
8. After all of the questions have been run through, display the first question again.
